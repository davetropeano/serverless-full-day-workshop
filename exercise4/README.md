# Exercise 4 - Using Cloud Function Triggers

Triggers for events are an integral part of building Serverless applications. In this exercise, we'll create triggers to invoke our Cloud Functions, rather than just calling them manually from the CLI or Web browser.

Goals:
* Setup triggers to invoke Cloud Functions 
* Learn how to:
    * Create a trigger 
    * Invoke a Cloud Function when a Cloudant database insertion occurs
    * Use an alarm trigger to call a Cloud Function every N minutes
